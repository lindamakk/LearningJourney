🎯 LearningJourney: Your Daily Learning Habit Builder
LearningJourney is a SwiftUI application designed to help users build and maintain consistent daily learning habits using streak tracking and an Freeze mechanic.

✨ Key Features

Goal & Duration Setting: Users define a learning goal and commit to a specific duration (Week, Month, Year).

Daily Check-in: Press "Learned Today" to continue the streak.

Streak Freeze: Use a "Freeze" to skip a day without breaking the streak. The number of freezes available depends on the duration set:

Week: 2 Freezes

Month: 8 Freezes

Year: 9 Freezes

Calendar View: Displays a history of all past days learned, missed, or frozen.

Goal Reset: Updating the Goal or Duration will reset the current streak.
